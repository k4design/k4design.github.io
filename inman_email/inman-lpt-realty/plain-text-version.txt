IN JUST 30 SECONDS!

Keeping clients informed and navigating the market shouldn’t feel like a full-time job. At LPT Realty, we believe brokerages should empower agents with the insights and strategies they need to succeed.

We kick off every week with Motivational Monday, a company-wide Zoom session led by our founder and CEO, Robert Palmer.

Motivational Monday isn’t just a pep talk—it’s a weekly dose of industry insights, strategies, and inspiration to help agents dominate the week ahead.

We’ve never missed one, and we won’t start now.

At LPT Realty, we’re more than a brokerage. We’re about agent choice and letting you create your own definition of success. No matter the path—we’ll help you get there.
