Watch LPT Founder Robert Palmer share how to explain the market to customers—

IN JUST 30 SECONDS!

Keeping clients informed and navigating the market shouldn’t feel like a full-time job. At LPT Realty, we believe brokerages should empower agents with the insights and strategies they need to succeed.

Every week, we kick off the week with Motivational Monday, a company-wide session led by our founder and CEO, Robert Palmer.

Motivational Monday isn’t just a pep talk—it’s a weekly dose of industry insights, strategies, and inspiration to help agents dominate the week ahead.

We’ve never missed one, and we won’t start now.

At LPT Realty, we’re more than a brokerage. We’re all about agent choice and letting you define your success. Not matter the path—we’ll help you get there.
