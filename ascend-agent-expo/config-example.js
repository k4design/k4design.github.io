// ===== HOW TO USE THIS CONFIG =====
/*
1. Copy this file to 'config.js'
2. Customize all the data above for your event
3. Add this line to your HTML before script.js:
   <script src="config.js"></script>
4. Add this line to the end of script.js:
   if (typeof customEventData !== 'undefined') {
       Object.assign(eventData, customEventData);
   }

This allows you to keep your customizations separate from the main template files,
making it easier to update the template in the future while preserving your content.
